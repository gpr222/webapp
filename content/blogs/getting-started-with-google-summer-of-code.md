excerpt: This spring, I was selected to participate in [Google Summer of Code
  (GSoC)](http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), a program that pairs student
  developers with open source projects. I was selected for a project with
  Chromium Organization which involved writing code and libraries which will
  promote use of AudioWorklet API and reduce use of deprecated
  ScriptProcessorNode API.
